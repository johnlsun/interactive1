					<div class="scroll-arrow"></div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p><em>&ldquo;Our owner, Rich DeVos, said, &lsquo;Why not us? Why not now?&rsquo; Everybody was saying we&rsquo;re
					too young to win a championship. We hadn&rsquo;t suffered enough. Little did we know, we would be
					suffering by the end.&rdquo; </em><span class="attribution">â€”Tree Rollins</span></p>

			<div class="open-trigger first" data-trigger-index="2"></div>
			<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>hey were destined for greatness. Back in the mid-1990s, you couldn&rsquo;t
				imagine a more promising basketball pairing than the Orlando Magic&rsquo;s Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal and
				Anfernee &ldquo;Penny&rdquo; Hardaway. O&rsquo;Neal was powerful and agile, plus swift and skillful in a
				way that hadn&rsquo;t been seen in a 7-footer since Wilt Chamberlain (and hasn&rsquo;t been seen since O&rsquo;Neal
				retired). Hardaway was seen as the rightful heir to Magic Johnson â€” a tall, transcendent point guard who
				would headline the new generation of NBA superstars. If you wanted to build an ideal basketball team,
				you would start with a center and a point guard. If you wanted to build the perfect team, you would
				start with O&rsquo;Neal and Hardaway. The Magic, only a few years removed from their lowly
				expansion-team origins, skyrocketed to fame with their abundant talent and black-and-white pinstripes. O&rsquo;Neal
				and Hardaway were surrounded by capable role players like Dennis Scott, Brian Shaw, Nick Anderson, and
				Horace Grant. Together, they seemed poised to become the NBA&rsquo;s next dynasty.</p>

			<p>Perhaps no NBA team has ever featured two players more marketable than O&rsquo;Neal and Hardaway. The two
				filmed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109305/" target="_blank"><em>Blue Chips</em></a> together
				and became dueling campaign faces for Nike and Reebok. O&rsquo;Neal had his wide smile and an outsize
				personality to match his towering physique. Hardaway was more reserved, but possessed that unforgettable
				nickname and a Chris Rockâ€“voiced alter ego to talk trash for him. The possibilities seemed endless, as
				if the championship rings and parades would be a formality.</p>

			<div class="open-trigger first" data-trigger-index="3"></div>
			<p>And then it ended. The Magic&rsquo;s competitive window slammed shut faster than anyone imagined, thanks
				to O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s unexpected departure to Los Angeles, the firing of Magic coach Brian Hill, and
				the decline of Hardaway&rsquo;s game thanks to knee injuries. It took years for the franchise to build
				another competitive team, and even though the Dwight Howardâ€“led Magic reached the NBA Finals in 2009,
				the pride mixed with disappointment from 1995 and &rsquo;96 remained strong.</p>

			<p>The Shaq and Penny Magic are in an unfortunate class similar to the &rsquo;70s Blazers, <a
					href="http://grantland.com/features/an-oral-history-hakeem-olajuwon-ralph-sampson-1980s-houston-rockets/"
					target="_blank">&rsquo;80s Rockets</a>, or <a

A window opened for the team to advance to the top of the Eastern Conference after Michael Jordan retired in 1993. (Jordan would return more than halfway through the 1994-95 season.) Horace Grant was a reliable two-way power forward who had already won three championships with the Bulls. Chicago believed it had a deal to re-sign Grant, but Grant bristled over not being signed earlier. In July 1994, he bolted to Orlando for $17 million over five years. &ldquo;I left on a clear conscience,&rdquo; Grant told the </em>Orlando Sentinel<em>. &ldquo;The [Bulls] organization had the problems, not me. When we were winning, they kept everything under the rug, but now that they&rsquo;re struggling, you see all these things coming out. Obviously Jerry [Krause] is a liar.&rdquo; To clear cap space for Grant&rsquo;s salary, the Magic traded Scott Skiles and a future first-rounder for just a second-round pick. They were ready to let Hardaway run the offense. </em></p></div><div class="cb"></div><div class="character-section "><div class="actor"><div class="actor-image"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/espn-grantland/specials/1990s-orlando-magic-oral-history/assets/images/characters/john-gabriel.png" alt="john-gabriel" /></div><div class="actor-text"><h3>John Gabriel</h3><div class="character">team executive, later general manager, Orlando Magic</div></div></div><p>Cap room was a bit of a newfound commodity.

O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s decision to leave Orlando for Los Angeles helped convince the NBA to institute a luxury tax for teams that exceed the salary cap. The tax was partly intended to restrict big-market franchises&rsquo; ability to lure marquee players away from the teams that drafted them, although it underestimated many owners&rsquo; willingness to pay penalties in pursuit of assembling a championship roster. The reign of two of the generation&rsquo;s finest talents playing together was cut short, Hardaway&rsquo;s health gradually deteriorated, and the question of how good the Magic could have been lingers as one of the great &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; in NBA history.</em></p></div><div class="cb"></div><div class="character-section "><div class="actor"><div class="actor-image"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/espn-grantland/specials/1990s-orlando-magic-oral-history/assets/images/characters/brian-shaw.png" alt="brian-shaw" /></div><div class="actor-text"><h3>Brian Shaw</h3><div class="character">guard, Orlando Magic</div></div></div><p>It&rsquo;s a shame we couldn&rsquo;t stay together longer.

The Magic, who boasted several prolific shooters in Scott, Anderson, Shaw, and Hardaway, made good use of the change. In their four Finals games, the Magic attempted 118 3-pointers, nearly 30 per game. The 3-point shot has become increasingly vital in the modern NBA, but to date, no team has averaged more 3-point attempts in a Finals series than the Magic did 20 years ago.

It was almost unheard of in those days for a team to give up rotation players for so little in return, and several teams were <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-06-09/sports/9806090288_1_antoine-walker-top-celtics-george-lynch" target="_blank">reportedly angry</a> that Vancouver allowed the Lakers to free up cap space for O&rsquo;Neal without taking a player back in the deal. Even then-Lakers coach Del Harris had trouble recognizing what the trade would mean for the Lakers&rsquo; future when it was first announced. "Del felt with Sedale Threatt and Anthony Peeler, he had the best backcourt in the NBA from one through four," a source close to Harris <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/deals-kobe-glad-harris-not-article-1.743680" target="_blank">told the <em>New York Daily News</em></a>.

Before the 1998-99 lockout, which established the rookie contract scale and protections like restricted free agency to insure teams against losing star players, a no. 1 pick like Glenn Robinson, in 1994, was able to demand a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/04/sports/pro-basketball-bucks-give-robinson-a-10-year-contract.html" target="_blank">10-year, $68 million contract</a> before he&rsquo;d ever played an NBA game. The same year, Chris Webber <a href="http://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2012/9/5/3295034/disappointment-day-golden-" target="_blank">forced his way out of Golden State</a> after his rookie season with the Warriors, because he had clashed with then-coach Don Nelson. Examples abound: Juwan Howard&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.truthaboutit.net/2010/04/cardboard-bullets-juwan-howard-the-original-100-million-man.html" target="_blank">$101 million contract</a>, Stephon Marbury <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/99911-kg-and-marbury-remembering-the-early-years" target="_blank">demanding a trade from Minnesota</a> because he couldn&rsquo;t be the team&rsquo;s biggest star, Alonzo Mourning&rsquo;s <a href="http://articles.philly.com/1995-11-04/sports/25681814_1_hornets-dell-curry-rafael-addison" target="_blank">contract standoff and eventual departure</a> from Charlotte.
