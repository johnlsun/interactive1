								<p>Millennials, now the largest generation in the workforce, have a reputation for demanding greater flexibility in the workplace — and maybe even for being slackers. However, a new study by Project: Time Off shows that Millennials are more likely than other generations to forgo vacation and feel guilty and afraid about the prospect of taking time off.</p>

								<p>It might not be a coincidence that many Millennials entered the workforce during the Great Recession and have faced job instability and sky-high rates of student loans.</p>

								<p>Millennials are the most educated generation in history.  Among the Millennials in the United States, 27% of women and 21% of men between the ages of 18-33, have at least a bachelor’s degree.</p>

								<p>A look at history shows that we're probably just like our parents, who were also told that they were narcissistic know-nothings, as were their parents before them and on and on. The baby boomers and Generation X, today's scolders, were both derided as generations of self-absorbed slackers, too.</p>

								<p>The Baby Boomers were considered so spoiled and self-absorbed that the writer Tom Wolfe dubbed the 1970s the “Me Decade.” Then came Generation X, which was considered to have so little interest in working hard that they were called “slackers.”</p>

								<p>One of the characteristics of Millennials, besides the fact that they are masters of digital communication, is that they are primed to do well by doing good. Almost 70% say that giving back and being civically engaged are their highest priorities.</p>

								<p>Millennials typically earn 20% less than their previous generation counterparts entering the workforce. Millennials also face a greater cost of living and greater debt due to rising education costs. If one graduated college during the Carter or Reagan presidencies, you entered an economy that was adding between 150,000 and 250,000 jobs a month. Over the past 14 years? Not so much.</p>

								<p>When you think about Millennials living at home and deifying self-aggrandizing behavior, remember the economic hardships that they have endured.</p>

								<p>There is a notion out there that Millennials are fundamentally not as tough and are more entitled than any generation before it.  Conveniently left out of this discussion are all of the sacrifices that were made and provided to the Baby Boomers and Generation X. One need only look at the economic climate that was present during their rise in the workplace.</p>

								<p>It’s fair to say that from 1945-1980, the United States experienced unprecedented growth as a nation. In Michael French’s book U.S. Economic History Since 1945, he noted that U.S. industrial production was 45% of world output in 1948 and its national incomes and productivity, especially in manufacturing, far out-stripped other economies. He noted that between the years of 1945 and 1969, levels of productivity in the United States were the international exemplar. This means that of any generation, Baby Boomers and Generation X had the most “coddling” in terms of financial stability. Theirs was a time when people in all sectors of the economy worked, and could provide for their families despite a lack of diversity or acceptance of different cultures. These days the typical Millennial will start their career with $37,000 in student debt.</p>

								<p>Stable full-time jobs are disappearing along with health benefits for newer graduates</p>
