	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe New Typography [1923] - Laszlo Moholy-Nagy
<br></br>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTypography is a tool of communication.

	It must be &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcommunication in its most intense form.

	The &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspemphasis must be on absolute clarity since this &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdistinguishes the character of our own writing from &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat of ancient pictographic forms.

	Our intellectual &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsprelationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g., &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis individual-exact relationship is in a state of &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptransition toward a collective-exact orientation).

	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is in contrast to the ancient individual- &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspamorphous and later collective- amorphous mode &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof communication.

	Therefore priority: unequivocal &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspclarity in all typographical compositions. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLegibility-communication must never be impaired &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspby an a priori aesthetics.</p>
