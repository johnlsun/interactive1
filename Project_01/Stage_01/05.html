	The New Typography [1923] - Laszlo Moholy-Nagy

	<p>Typography is a tool of communication.</p>

	<p>It must be communication in its most intense form.</p>

	<p>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms.</p>

	<p>Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g., this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation).</P>

	<p>This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication.</p>

	<p>Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.</p>
